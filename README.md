# Terraform Cloud
## What are the prerequisites?

You must have an AWS account and provide your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key to Terraform Cloud. Terraform Cloud encrypts and stores variables using [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/). For more information on how to store variables in Terraform Cloud, see [our variable documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/variables.html).

The values for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` should be saved as environment variables on your workspace.
